#+TITLE: Sketch mode
#+DESCRIPTION: Quickly create simple SVG sketches using the mouse

* Prepreliminary comment
  The initial version with the transient can be found in the 'transient-version'
  branch. This version introduced a toolbar which made the transient
  unnecessary. Also removing the transient frees up drawing space. It has been
  replaced by a hydra which is togglable. Also an earlier version showed the
  mouse coordinate position in the mode-line. However, this functionality
  hinders the 'interactive' drawing (which might be due to an emacs 'bug').
  Anyway, you can toggle showing the coordinates by pressing =t c= (maybe it
  works more fluently on your system).

* Preliminary comment
  This is a new package that is still in development. It has been on ELPA-devel
  for a while now, but it did not yet attract any code contributors. However,
  despite that the code and docs are far from polished/finished, its main
  functionality is very usable already, so that it is probably a good time to
  publish it on ELPA. On the other hand, several (or most) features are not
  implemented completely, simply because implementing these things take time,
  and I should first focus on keeping myself alive 😐. But if you know some
  elisp, than it should be quite straightforward to complete the implementation
  of those features (and create a PR). The idea is that elisp users can add
  functionalities easily so that the package becomes ever more versatile. Users
  can also contribute by creating SVG snippets (in a separate repo, or create a
  PR). Any feedback, for example suggestions for enhancing the
  interface/usability (and of course bug reports), is very welcome (probably
  best by opening an issue). Also, any contributions are very welcome. The code
  of the package is very accessible (especially if you quickly read how to use
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html][edebug]]).

  A list of ideas for implementation can be found in the preliminary comment in
  the =sketch.el= file and additionally in the [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/sketch-mode/wiki/vision][wiki]] section.
  
** Included features
   - mnemonic shortcuts + hydra and (alternatively) a toolbar
   - quickly insert image definition into new type (image) org-block with the
     image rendered as overlay (no external file required)
   - snap to grid (on minor-grid, however major and minor grid are fully
     configurable)
   - draw text
   - crop final image
   - set stroke, fill, width etc.
   - show dom (lisp) in other window
   - draw angle arcs (between lines, available soon, I hope. See
     =implement-angle-arc= branch)
     
** Incomplete features (merged into main)
   - Draw labels (not implemented for all type of objects. Easy to implement)
     
     It would be handy to have a 'transform group' option also. [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform][SVG groups allow
     for easy transformations]]. Then it would probably be handy to wrap all
     objects in group tags.

** Delicious low hanging fruit
   - use svg snippets (i.e. design object in external programs like inkscape,
     geogebra etc., end quickly insert them in your sketches)

** Less low hanging fruit
   - draw directly in you literate org file, with the dom updated in your source block
   - export to tikz, asymptote, other image extensions etc. (probably requires
     to implement 'nodes')
     
  The =sketch-mode.el= file starts with listing TODO items describing features
  that are missing from the package.

  *THIS SCREENCAST STILL SHOWS THE SKETCH-MODE TRANSIENT VERSION. AN UPDATED
  SCREENSHOT WILL HOPEFULLY ARRIVE TOMORROW*

* Installation
  The package is available from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/sketch-mode.html][GNU ELPA]], so it can simply get installed as
  usual. However, the publishing 'cycle' on ELPA is somewhat slow, while
  development on this package is 'less slow'. So you might prefer to install
  from github directly as follows:
  
  Either =git clone= the package and load =sketch-mode.el= using =load file=
  either manually or from =.emacs.d=.

  When installing the package it probably still shows some warnings, you can
  safely ignore them.
  
  Alternatively you could use [[quelpa][https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa]] with the
  following recipe:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (quelpa '(sketch-mode :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode" :fetcher github))
 #+end_src 
 then subsequently load the package with
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
#+end_src  

** Spacemacs
  The package is available from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/sketch-mode.html][GNU ELPA]], so it can simply get installed by
  simply adding =sketch-mode= to =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=. However,
  the publishing 'cycle' on ELPA is somewhat slow, while development on this
  package is 'less slow'. So you might prefer to install from github directly as
  follows:
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (sketch-mode :location (recipe
                     :fetcher github
                     :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode"
                     :files ("*.el" "snippet-files")))
#+end_src

  Subsequently load the packages by adding the following line to =dotspacemacs/user-config=
  
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
 #+end_src 

* Usage
  Start a sketch with =M-x sketch= and enter values at the prompts (or prefix
  with =C-u= to use default values). Although, thanks to the =hydra=
  package, the usage is more or less self explanatory, it is wise to take note
  of the following comments:

  - use =C-c C-c= to quickly insert the xml-definition into the (org-mode)
    buffer from which sketch-mode was called and create the image as an overlay.
    The image will get inserted within a new =image= org block type. SVG/XML is
    suitable for inserting directly in an org file so that you do not need to
    store the image separately on disk (which is nice feature when sharing
    files). The new block type is not yet 'officially supported' by org-mode, so
    that it will not yet get exported as an image (HELP WANTED :nerd:), but the
    image in the code block can be toggle with =C-c C-c=.
  - Alternatively you can write the image to a file by pressing =S= (S-ave).
  - Before you insert the image you can use =C-S mouse-drag= to crop the image.
  - You can move an object by pressing =m= to open the 'modify-object' state.
    This will select the object and activate the =translate= mouse action so
    that you can drag the object using the mouse.
  - to remove an object (without using undo), you should press =d=, and then the
    label of the object you want removed.
  - You can also modify the drawing by changing the object definition (i.e.
    elisp). For that press =d= to open the definition in a side-window, then
    press =.= to hide (deactivate the) hydra (keymap). Now modify the code
    and press =C-c C=c=, to load it and update the =\*sketch\*= buffer.    

* Bugs
  Currently when undoing all (drawing of) objects, sketch-mode gets confused and
  further drawing is not possible anymore (although redoing is). This is
  probably a very easy to solve bug, but has not been a priority yet.

* Alternatives
  [[https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2021/08/scribble-notes-in-gnu-emacs.html][canvas-mode]]: An even newer package is being created which provides some
  additional features (although =sketch-mode= is still in development and most
  probably will get most of these features too). Unfortunately, the package is
  not (yet?) very compatible with =sketch-mode=.
  
* Sponsor the project
  It takes me a lot of time to develop (this) package(s), while, as we would say in
  the Netherlands, I have no penny to scratch my butt. Therefore, although I am
  also really happy to offer it for free, if you find [[https://github.com/dalanicolai][my package(s)]] (real
  projects page in the making) useful (e.g. for you work), and if you can afford
  it, then I would be very happy with any donation (of course that would also
  enable me to work on your feature requests). As soon as I have the
  opportunity/possibility to find a stable job, I will happily suggest you to
  transfer or donate to other projects/charity instead.

  If you would like to =boost= development of any of my projects, then
  contribute (code or documentation), or consider more sustainable financial
  support (i.e. sponsor).
