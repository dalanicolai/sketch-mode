#+TITLE: Sketch mode
#+DESCRIPTION: Quickly create simple SVG sketches using the mouse

* Preliminary comment
  This is a new package that is still in development. However, its main
  functionality is very usable already. Any feedback, for example suggestions
  for enhancing the interface/usability, is very welcome (probably best by
  opening an issue). Also, any contributions are very welcome. The code of the
  package is very accessible (especially if you quickly read how to use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html][edebug]].

** Included features
   - snap to grid
   - draw text
   - crop finale image
   - set stroke, fill, width etc.
   - show dom (lisp) in other window
   - draw angle arcs (between lines, available soon)
   - save drawing presets using [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Saving-Values][transient's saving values feature]] (documentation
     contribution welcome)
     
** Delicious low hanging fruit
   - use svg snippets (i.e. design object in external programs like inkscape,
     geogebra etc., end quickly insert them in your sketches)
   - export to tikz, asymptote, other image extensions etc.

** Less low hanging fruit
   - draw directly in you literate org file, with the dom updated in your source block
     
  The =sketch-mode.el= file starts with listing TODO items describing features
  that are missing from the package.

* Installation
  When installing the package it probably still shows some warnings, you can
  safely ignore them.
  
  Either =git clone= the package and load =sketch-mode.el= using =load file=
  either manually or from =.emacs.d=.

  Alternatively you could use a [[quelpa][https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa]] with the
  following recipe:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (quelpa '(sketch-mode :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode" :fetcher github))
 #+end_src 
 then subsequently load the package with
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
#+end_src  

** Spacemacs
  Add the following lines to =dotspacemacs-additional-packages=
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (sketch-mode :location (recipe
                        :fetcher github
                        :repo "dalanicolai/sketch-mode"))
#+end_src

  Subsequently load the packages by adding the following line to =dotspacemacs/user-config=
  
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sketch-mode
    :defer t)
 #+end_src 

* Usage
  Start a sketch with =M-x sketch= and enter values at the prompts (or prefix
  with =C-u= to use default values). Although, thanks to the =transient=
  package, the usage is more or less self explanatory, it is wise to take note
  of the following comments:

  - the undo/redo functionality is really basic, and does not work for all actions
    (e.g. does not work yet when removing object or cropping images).
  - to remove an object (without using undo), you should toggle labels by
    pressing =l=, and then to remove an object enter its label after pressing
    =R=.
  - You can hide the transient by pressing =q=, and you can go back to sketch
    mode via =M-x sketch= (or =C-c C-t= when still in the sketch-mode buffer)

  Create your sketch and then save
  the file by pressing =S=.

* Sponsor the project
  Due to a combination of unfortunate circumstances, I am in an unfortunate
  financial situation (dependent on my family, in the Netherlands we would say:
  I have no penny to scratch my butt), therefore if you find [[my
  package(s)]][project page link to be inserted] useful, and if you can afford it,
  then I would be very happy with any small (or less small) donation.
  As soon as I have the opportunity/possibility to find a real job, I will
  happily suggest you to transfer donate to other projects/charity.

  If you would like to =boost= development of any of my projects, then
  contribute (code or documentation), or consider more sustainable financial
  support (i.e. sponsor).
